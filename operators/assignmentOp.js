// assignment operator

// The assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. For example:
let a = 5;
console.log(a); // Output: 5, because the assignment operator assigns the value 5 to the variable a.        

// The assignment operator can also be used to assign the result of an expression to a variable. For example:
let b = a + 10;
console.log(b); // Output: 15, because the assignment operator assigns the result of the expression a + 10 to the variable b, which is 15 in this case.

// The assignment operator can also be used with other operators to perform a calculation and assign the result to a variable in one step. For example:
a += 10; // This is equivalent to a = a + 10
console.log(a); // Output: 15, because the += operator adds 10 to the current value of a (which is 5) and assigns the result back to a, which is 15 in this case.
